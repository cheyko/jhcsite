Africa was the last continent \n                                to be hit by the virus and has not experienced as much devestation as other continents. \n                                Meanwhile many countries are currently experiencing the second wave of the outbreak and \n                                a new variant called the 'Delta Variant'. West Africa, with a population of 367 million \n                                people, had confirmed 412 178 cases of COVID-19 with 5363 deaths as of 14 March 2021; \n                                compared with the USA which had recorded almost 30 million cases and 530 000 deaths, \n                                despite having a slightly smaller population (328 million). Several reasons have been \n                                made in an attempt to explain this phenomenon. One was that African countries have \n                                leveraged on experiences from past epidemics to build resilience and response strategies \n                                which may be contributing to protecting the continent’s health systems from being overwhelmed.\n                                </p>\n                                <br />\n                                <p className=\"p-format\">\n                                  The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has been monitoring the situation in the region \n                                  as well as the <a style={{color:\"green\"}} href=\"https://www.afro.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus-covid-19\"> regional offices</a> of The World Health Organisation.
