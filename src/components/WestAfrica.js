                                                    West Africa is as the name suggest, is the western most region on the African Continent. The Economic 
                                                    Community of West African States (Ecowas) established on May 28, 1975 via the Treaty of Lagos is
                                                    comprised of 15 member states. These include Benin, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Cote dâ€™ Ivoire, 
                                                    The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Senegal and Togo.
                                                    With over 300 million people and spanning an area of over 5.1 million square kilometers, the region is
                                                    one of the fatest developing areas in Africa. Officially these member states use English, French and Portugese
                                                    as their languages however there are several other languages that are spoken by the people of west africa.
                                                    <br /> <br />
                                                    Historically, the area was host many prominent kingdoms and empires such as the Ghana, Mali Songhai, Wolof,
                                                    Oyo, Benin and Kanem Bornu. During these historical periods, West Africa was a logistical hub for goods being 
                                                    transported between the Northern and Southern regions of the african continent. An array of items such as gold,
                                                    advanced iron-workings and ivory were traded in these regions. After discovering these castly rich local
                                                    Communities and kingdoms, European Officials capitalized on the existing slave systems and created what is known as 
                                                    the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade. Exploitation of the region continued post slavery which prompted West African leaders
                                                    to challenge the colonial hierarchy and demand Independence for their respective states.
                                                    <br /> <br />
                                                    With West Africa being situated to the South and West of the Sahara; the area experiences dry winds during Harmattan
                                                    and With the region being to the East and North of the Atlantic, the coutries experince seasonal mansoons.
                                                    This demographic allows for West Africa's unique ecology, Strong biodiversity and a plethora of
                                                    distinct regions.
